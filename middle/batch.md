Sure, I can help you create a simple batch script to run `npm start` in two different folders. You'll need to replace `path\to\your\first\folder` and `path\to\your\second\folder` with the actual paths to your folders. Here's a basic example of what this script might look like:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d path\to\your\first\folder
call npm start
cd /d path\to\your\second\folder
call npm start
pause
```

Here's a breakdown of what each line in the script does:

- `@echo off`: This command turns off the display of the commands in the script, making the output cleaner. It's optional but can make the script output more readable.
- `cd /d path\to\your\first\folder`: This changes the directory to your first folder. The `/d` switch is used to change the current drive in addition to changing the current directory for a drive.
- `call npm start`: This runs the `npm start` command in the current directory. The `call` command is used to call another batch file from the current one, but it's also useful here to ensure that your script continues to the next line after `npm start` completes.
- `cd /d path\to\your\second\folder`: This changes the directory to your second folder.
- `call npm start`: This again runs the `npm start` command in the current directory.
- `pause`: This command is optional. It pauses the script's execution and displays a message asking the user to press a key to continue. This is useful if you're running the script manually and want to see the output before the window closes.

To use this script:

1. Open Notepad or your favorite text editor.
2. Copy and paste the script above into your editor.
3. Replace `path\to\your\first\folder` and `path\to\your\second\folder` with the actual paths to your folders.
4. Save the file with a `.bat` extension, for example, `run_npm_starts.bat`.
5. Double-click the batch file to run it, or run it from the command line.

This script assumes that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed and configured in your system's PATH. If `npm start` fails to run, make sure Node.js and npm are properly installed and accessible from the command line.
